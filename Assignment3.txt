1) Write a C/CPP program to create a child process. Child should print its pid and its parent’s pid and should exit by printing message as “Child Exiting …”. Parent should print its pid and should exit by printing message as “Parent Exiting ..”. 
   (Hint(functions to be used) : getpid, fork, getppid) 
------------------>
#include<iostream>
#include<sys/types.h>
#include<unistd.h>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
        pid_t pid;
        pid=fork();
        if( pid == 0 ){
                cout<<"this is child process : "<<getpid()<<endl;
        }else if( pid > 0 ){
                cout<<"this is parent process : "<<getppid()<<endl;
                cout<<"Child Exiting....."<<endl;
        }
        else{
                cout<<"process is not created";
        }
        return 0;
}
